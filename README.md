# udacity-intro-hadoop
This repository contains my mappers and reducers for the final project for Udacity's [Intro to Hadoop & MapReduce Course](http://https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-hadoop-and-mapreduce--ud617).

The test data is contained in the folder test_data, while the real udacity forum data can be found [here](http://content.udacity-data.com/course/hadoop/forum_data.tar.gz) (note that is a direct link to a .tar.gz file).

I believe this repository demonstrates my proficiency in writing mappers and reducers for Hadoop and other distributed systems. It may also help someone else trying to take the course or learn Hadoop/MapReduce.
